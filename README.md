# 7ctx RAT
Java Remote Administration tool

## 7ctx RAT module
* Client, communicates with the server
* Server, communicates with the client

## TODO
* Make it more user friendly.. (eg. executable client jar builder), user shouldn't have to touch the code at all!
* Finish unfinished socketUI
* Make file explorer/downloader from client
* Refactor

### HOW-TO
```
1. Open as maven project
2. Read every class to get a understanding :P
3. Change some constants and configurations: (server config = ./config.properties and client config = ./config.json)
4. Modify to your needs
```
